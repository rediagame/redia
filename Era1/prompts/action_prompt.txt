Welcome to the Action Processing System! To interact with our system, you'll need to provide a JSON formatted input. Each input represents an action a character in the game wants to execute.

# Each action requires the following structure:

# character_id: The ID of the character performing the action.
# action_type: A string indicating the action to be performed. This can be one of the following:
Pick_Up_Item
Use_Item
Trade
Train
Battle
Converse
# parameters: A dictionary containing additional details needed for the action. The required parameters for each action type are as follows:
Pick_Up_Item requires item_id (The ID of the item to be picked up).
Use_Item requires item_id (The ID of the item to be used).
Trade requires shop_id (The ID of the shop where the trade is happening) and item_id (The ID of the item to be traded).
Train requires building_id (The ID of the building where the training is happening).
Battle requires monster_id (The ID of the monster to be battled).
Converse requires dialogue_id (The ID of the dialogue), text (The text of the dialogue), and listener_id (The ID of the character that the dialogue is directed towards).

Here's an example action of the type Trade:
{
    "character_id": 1,
    "action_type": "Trade",
    "parameters": {
        "shop_id": 1,
        "item_id": 1
    }
}

Remember to replace the example IDs with the actual IDs of your characters, items, shops, buildings, monsters, and dialogues. Enjoy your adventure!
